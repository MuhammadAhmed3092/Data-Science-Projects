This project focuses on analyzing data from over 70+ football leagues spanning the years 2019 to 2023. The project utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into various aspects of football leagues. The project incorporates several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and tabulate, to perform data analysis and visualization. Key components of the project include:

## Correlation Heatmap

The correlation heatmap provides a visual representation of the relationships between different variables within the football league dataset. By utilizing the seaborn library, this analysis helps identify potential correlations between various factors, such as goals scored, team performance and more. The heatmap allows for a quick understanding of which variables are positively or negatively correlated, facilitating insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success.

## Relation Analysis

The relation analysis section focuses on exploring the relationships between different entities within the football league dataset. By using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, this analysis allows for understanding the interactions between various factors, such as team statistics and league dynamics. It helps in identifying trends, patterns, or dependencies that can shed light on team strategies or league performance.

## Distribution of Data

The distribution analysis aims to uncover the distribution patterns of specific variables within the football league dataset. By utilizing matplotlib and seaborn, this analysis provides insights into the spread and frequency of values, such as goals scored by winner or season. It helps in understanding the overall distribution characteristics and identifying potential outliers or anomalies that may impact team or league analysis.
